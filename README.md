# Node_Sandbox

The idea behind this application is for me to experiment with nodeJS and express.

The Basic plan is for the application to Create Read Update And Delete data from a MONGODB server.

Step 1: Create the connection to the DB and the store Schema
Step 2: Create the Interface for entering the data, and displaying the data.
Step 3: Create the mechanism for deleting data
Step 4: Create the mechanism for editing data
